TL;DR version

TwinAphex, a person some people refer to as "the dictator of libretro" loves to mess, fork and take over projects and is suspected of running smudge campaigns against people he doesn't like.

He is generally highly poisonous both to his projects (libretro/retroarch) and others (reicast one of them, dolphin another, etc). Some libretro devs have already been banned from the libretro discord for speaking their mind openly. He often censors/edits his comments, and then blames others for the drama that comes...
(For reference see from earlier today: https://pastebin.com/WrhzTRHi)

Some recent developments triggered this wave of drama.

We want him to stop messing around, and publicly apologize for the damage he has done, so we can carry on making good emulators.

While the libretro and retroarch projects are very promising, however TwinAphex has completely lost our trust to run them.

We prefer democracies.

*addendum*
It is my personal opinion that TwinAphex should take some vacations to chill and figure things out. There are many capable libretro team members he can trust the libretro project to. Seeing a therapist helped me in my recovery a lot when I was last burned out. Everyone can get burned out.

Dear Internet,

To make things abundantly clear, I have used my CLA powers only once, last weekend, to re-license Reicast's source code to flyinghead**, a libretro dev, in a futile attempt to de-escalate this after he forked reicast. I am not secretly sharing code with inolen. 

Reicast is open source, any code posted there can be seen by anyone. There's no need for me to do that.

For more details on the plans around the CLA please follow up on: https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator/issues/455 and http://positions.reicast.com. Feel free to leave your comments and proposal there, that ticket is an open discussion.

I think there's sufficient proof that both me and inolen are capable enough around Dreamcast Emulation, and Emulation overall, that we can write whatever we need without copying code from others.

We're both professionally employed to do that by a fairly large company, and I've personally freelanced for companies since 2005 as an emulator coder.

I also think that there's no reason to suspect me of any wrongdoing, as I've been a huge supporter of open source of various emulators, and a contributor to many.

I hope you can all see how ridiculous and delusional such statements are, and we can stop all this BS that's going on.

If you have too much free time, how about you do your part towards a solid, healthy, and sustainable emulator scene/community, instead of being poisonous/trolling/idling/isolated?

Take care everyone and good night,

~skmp (aka, drk||Raziel)

** I forgot about this yesterday, I did it to show my support and respect towards flyinghead while the drama was escalating, in a futile effort to de-escalate and restore trust. I do trust him to be ethical. See [beetle-dc#r33694886](https://github.com/libretro/beetle-dc/commit/9d0847c33bfa460621ea3311e416b25a300f062d#r33694886)
